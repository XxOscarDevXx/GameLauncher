# GameLauncher

This is an game launcher make with python
This project is in beta. If you find any errors, please submit an issue describing the problem.
Happy Gaming!
NOTE: THIS PROJECT DOES NOT SUPPORT PIRACY. YOU MUST PROVIDE YOUR OWN GAMES.

UPDATE:This project will no longer receive updates, because I feel Python is a bit "slow" for an ambitious project like this. In the coming weeks, I'll try to create a similar project in a different programming language that better suits my needs. For those who used this application, don't worry (although the theme store I was planning will no longer be active) because I'll try to develop something similar. And as always: Happy Gaming
